        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>GoLive Musician’s League is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting live music culture, supporting original music, nurturing emerging bands, and actively collaborating with local businesses. Our mission is to create more stage opportunities for music enthusiasts while helping our partners attract audiences—achieving true mutual benefit.</p>
        <p>We began as an organically formed music community called “Weekend Jam,” initiated in late 2023 by a group of friends who share a passion for singing, instrumental performance, and the thrill of being on stage. Initially hosted as restaurant gigs, our events featured mostly amateur musicians with full-time jobs, often performing in a spontaneous, jam-style format. The jam style is perfect for attracting musicians to participate. Periodically, we also organize rehearsals and host high-quality themed concerts.</p>
        <p>As our influence grew, Weekend Jam evolved into a key platform for grassroots music culture in Silicon Valley. Regular performances are held every Saturday evening at several restaurants and bars in the bay area of North California, attracting musicians, vocalists, and music lovers to gather and share the joy and freedom of live music.</p>
        <h2>Vision and Future Development</h2>
        <p>As Weekend Jam continued to grow, we recognized the need for a more structured organization and stronger resource support to sustain and advance the local music ecosystem. Thus, we established GoLive Musician’s League to provide a solid foundation for the growth and spread of music culture in Silicon Valley and beyond through improved operations and outreach.</p>
        <p>Our goals include:</p>
        <ul>
